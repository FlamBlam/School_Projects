   <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>This is the About Me page, where I of course, say things about myself.</p>
  <br>
   <h2>Favourite Things:</h2>
    <ul>
     <li>Favorite colour: Not sure, but I like many.</li>
     <li>Favourite animal: Pterodactyls count, right?</li>
     <li>Favorite food: Same with colors, I'm not sure, yet like many.</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
   <h3>My Personality</h3>
    <p>For one, I am not a very social person, so I tend to stick to myself. I do get angry very easily, but I usually control it. Self control is very important to me. Despite the fact that I almost never express my emotions, my feelings and thoughts change, sometimes very abruptly. I'm also not very confident in myself and my work.
